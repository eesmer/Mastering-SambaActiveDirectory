## Preface
SambaAD, which is installed with the Samba software package, is an open-source software developed to provide Microsoft Active Directory services and is distributed under the GPLv3 license. <br>
SambaAD allows for the setup and management of a Domain and Active Directory environment. <br>
<br>
The Samba software project, which began development in 1991 with the aim of enabling Windows and UNIX/Linux environments to work together; <br>
- First achieved compatibility with LAN Manager and Workgroup environments through Samba 1. <br>
- With Samba 2, it provided NT4-Style Domain Controller services for Windows clients. <br>
- Samba 3 introduced file and printer sharing management and FileServer services. <br>
<br>
Finally, Samba 4 provided the setup and management services for a Domain and Active Directory environment. <br>
<br>
Named after the file and printer sharing protocol SMB, Samba has become a great tool for us thanks to the outstanding work of Andrew Triggel and the Samba Team. <br>
And today, we have an excellent option for setting up and managing Domain and Active Directory environments in production environments. <br>
<br>
**On Paradigm Shift** <br>
I'm not sure the paradigm example is the best fit for this work. <br>
<br>
If we define paradigm as the accepted way of doing things in a particular field, then Samba software is a great example of a paradigm shifter because it offers an alternative solution. <br>
Historically, paradigm shifts have been a way to bring about positive change. But sometimes, sticking too closely to the current model can get in the way of  new ideas. <br>
