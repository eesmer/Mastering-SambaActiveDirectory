## Preface
SambaAD, which is installed with the Samba software package, is an open-source software developed to provide Microsoft Active Directory services and is distributed under the GPLv3 license. <br>
SambaAD allows for the setup and management of a Domain and Active Directory environment. <br>
<br>
The Samba software project, which began development in 1991 with the aim of enabling Windows and UNIX/Linux environments to work together; <br>
- First achieved compatibility with LAN Manager and Workgroup environments through Samba 1. <br>
- With Samba 2, it provided NT4-Style Domain Controller services for Windows clients. <br>
- Samba 3 introduced file and printer sharing management and FileServer services. <br>
<br>
Finally, Samba 4 provided the setup and management services for a Domain and Active Directory environment. <br>
<br>
Named after the file and printer sharing protocol SMB, Samba has become a great tool for us thanks to the outstanding work of Andrew Triggel and the Samba Team. <br>
And today, we have an excellent option for setting up and managing Domain and Active Directory environments in production environments. <br>
<br>

**On Paradigm Shift** <br>
I'm not sure the paradigm example is the best fit for this work. <br>
<br>
If we define paradigm as the accepted way of doing things in a particular field, then Samba software is a great example of a paradigm shifter because it offers an alternative solution. <br>
Historically, paradigm shifts have been a way to bring about positive change. But sometimes, sticking too closely to the current model can get in the way of  new ideas. <br>
<br>
Regardless of whether this topic is the perfect example of a paradigm shift or if it's causing what's known as "paradigm paralysis," which makes it harder to learn and grow, we can still evaluate this work by focusing on the potential of open-source alternatives in the IT world today. <br>
<br>
Then, we can get started. <br>

**Acknowledgements** <br>
It's impossible not to acknowledge the efforts behind this work. <br>
Special thanks to the Samba project team and Andrew Triggel for their incredible contributions. <br>
Samba4 is a remarkable achievement. <br>
<br>
My goal with this work is to offer guidance and consistent study notes to Samba users and to those who are interested in learning and using Samba. <br>
